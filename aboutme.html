  <h3>Am just a guy...</h3> 
  <p>...who adores improving constantly no matter if it's psychology or something educational like creating this website.
    I believe in the sentence <q>We are never too old to learn.</q> I try to live up to this inspirational sentence everyday.
    I'm 28 Years old and study computer science at ETH Zurich. I already did a lot of jobs which am not going into it. I decided
    to switch my career path to computer science, because I was always fascinated about the possibilities we have with computers.
    Everything can be done with the help of it, so why not mastering it?
   </p>
    <br>
    <h4>What I do most of the time?</h4>
   <ul>
     <li>Making people laugh</li>
     <li>Learning all kind of things. Don't really matter if it's computer science, a new style of cooking or mastering the violine.</li>
     <li>Playing video games in a team</li>
     <li>Taking pictures without designing them, because this would <b>ruin</b> the beauty of the moment I grasped to hold!</li>
     <li>Sometimes I like to cook.</li>
     <li>Hiking</li>
     <li>Having and sometimes sharing philosophical thoughts</li>
     <li>I know how to speak 3 and a half real languages and I hope that I can make it to 4 or 5 languages soon.</li>
     <li>Computerwise I'm capable of programming in Java(&JavaScript), HTML and CSS.</li>
    </ul>
   <br>
   <p>Besides all of that, I work a lot on weekends. So I hope you can find the joy in learning something on my site even if I can't
     promises to update it often.</p>
