  <h3>Am just a guy...</h3> 
  <p>...who adores improving constantly no matter if it's psychology or something educational like creating this website.
    I believe in the sentence <q>We are never too old to learn.</q> I try to live up to this inspirational sentence everyday.
    Switzerland is my home country where I was born in 1993. Before I entered the 'Fernfachhochschule Zürich' I did 3 semesters at the ETH. 
    I already did a lot of jobs, especially in the economy/sales sector, which am not going into it now. I decided to switch my career path to computer science, 
    because I was always fascinated about the possibilities we have with a computer. Everything can be done with the help of it, so why not mastering it?
   </p>
    <br>
    <h4>What I do most of the time?</h4>
   <ul>
     <li>Making people laugh.</li>
     <li>Learning all kind of things. Don't really matter if it's computer science, a new style of cooking or mastering the violine.</li>
     <li>Playing video games in a team.</li>
     <li>Taking pictures without designing them, because this would <b>ruin</b> the beauty of the moment I grasped to hold! Below you can see a picture taken by me in Iceland.</li>
     <li>Hiking or generally taking a walk.</li>
     <li>Having and sometimes sharing philosophical thoughts.</li>
     <li>I know how to speak 3 and a half real languages and I hope that I can make it to 4 or 5 languages soon.</li>
     <li>Me and my computer communicate with each other in Java, Python or HTML/CSS.</li>
    </ul>
   <br>
   <p>Most of my projects can be seen on my GitHub profile: <a href="https://github.com/PetarJanosevic">GitHub Profile</a></li>. You can contact me on LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/petar-j-47421a232/">LinkedIn Profile</a></li></p>
